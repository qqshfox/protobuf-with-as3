You must have downloaded the protocol buffers source from google. Once downloaded
you can drop the "compiler" directory directly into (PB_SRC_DIR)/src/google/protobuf
and then compile the protocol buffers project as usual. 

-Windows
	There is a folder called vsprojects that conviently gives you the visual studio .sln, 
	you must add the whole AS3 source folder to this solution.
	
-Linux/Mac
	A modified Makefile.am is provided, you can drop this file into (PB_SRC_DIR)/src and
	be able to perform a make on it. (courtesy of Bart van Deenen)
	A modified Makefile.in is also available if you don't have automake installed. 


*** INSTALL ACTIONSCRIPT LIBRARY ****

1. There is a hard dependency on the BigInteger class of the http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/ project.
 The Best way to handle it is to include the as3crypto.swc from
 http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/downloads/list in the library dependency of your project.

2. drop added the "com" directory located in as3-lib/src right into your source path
for your actionscript project. If using Flex Builder, remember to visit the project
settings and turn on the lib files for compiling.
